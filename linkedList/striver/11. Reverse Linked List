Problem statement
You are given a Singly Linked List of integers. You need to reverse the Linked List by changing the links between nodes.
Example:

Input:
2 4 5 -1

Output:
5 4 2 -1

Explanation: 2->4->5 is the initial linked list. If we reverse this, we get 5->4->2

Node* reverseLinkedList(Node *head)
{
    // Write your code here
    if(head==NULL || head->next==NULL) return head;
    Node*forward=NULL,*pre=NULL,*current=head;
    while(current!=NULL){
        forward=current->next;
        current->next=pre;
        pre=current;
        current=forward;
    }
    return pre;
}

Time complexity - O(N)
Space Complexity - O(1)
