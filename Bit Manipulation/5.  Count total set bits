Problem statement
For a given integer 'N', you have to return the number of set bits in the binary representation of the numbers from 1 to 'N'.
In a binary number '1' is considered as a set bit and '0' as not set.



Example:
If 'N' is 4, then

1 has a binary representation of 1
2 has a binary representation of 10
3 has a binary representation of 11
4 has a binary representation of 100

Hence number of set bits is 5.

int count(int n){
    int count=0;
        while(n!=0){
         if(n&1==1){
             count++;
         }
         n=n>>1;
       }
       return count;
}

int countSetBits(int N)
{
    int ans=0;
    for(int i=1;i<=N;i++)
    {
        
       ans += count(i);
    }
    return ans;
}
