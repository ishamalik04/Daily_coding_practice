Problem statement
Given a number ‘N’ and a number ‘K’. Return true if ‘K’th bit of number is set, else return false.
Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 5, ‘K’ = 1

Output: YES

5 in binary can be written as 101 and as we can see a first bit from the right of 5 is set so the answer is 'YES'.

bool isKthBitSet(int n, int k)
{
    if ((n&(1<<k-1))!=0)
    return 1;
    else
    return 0;
}
