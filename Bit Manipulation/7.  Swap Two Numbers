Problem statement
You are given two numbers 'a' and 'b' as input.
You must swap the values of 'a' and 'b'.
For Example:
Input: 
'a' = 8, 'b' = 5

Output:
5 8

Explanation:
Initially, the value of 'a' and 'b' is 8 and 5, respectively.
After swapping, the value of 'a' is 5, and the value of 'b' is 8.

void swapNumber(int &a, int &b) {
	a=a^b;
	b=a^b;
	a=a^b;
}
