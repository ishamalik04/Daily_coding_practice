Problem statement
You are given a number 'N' and its reverse 'R'.
Return the number raised to the power of its own reverse. As answers can be very large, print the result modulo '10^9 + 7'.0
For Example:

For 'N' = 20, 'R' = 2
The answer is 400 since 20^2 as the reverse of 20 is 2.


int mod=1e9+7;

int solve(int a,int b){
if(b==1)
return a;
if(b==0)
return 1;
   long long  ans=solve(a,b/2) %mod;
   ans=(ans*ans)%mod;
    if(b%2==0){
        ans=ans%mod;
    }
    else{
        ans=a*ans%mod;
    }
    return ans;
}
int power(int N, int R){
   // Write your code here.
    solve(N,R);
}
