Problem statement
Given an integer 'N', determine the maximum number of nodes present on 'Nth' level in a binary tree.
For Example:

N = 3
For level 1, we have 1 node.
For level 2, we have 2 nodes.
For level 3, we have 4 nodes
Output = 4, as level 3 has maximum 4 nodes.

int numberOfNodes(int N){
    return 1<<(N-1);
}

Time Complexity - O(1)
Space Complexity - O(1)
