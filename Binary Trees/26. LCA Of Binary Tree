Problem statement
You have been given a Binary Tree of distinct integers and two nodes ‘X’ and ‘Y’. You are supposed to return the LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) of ‘X’ and ‘Y’.
The LCA of ‘X’ and ‘Y’ in the binary tree is the shared ancestor of ‘X’ and ‘Y’ that is located farthest from the root.

Note :
You may assume that given ‘X’ and ‘Y’ definitely exist in the given binary tree.

int lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode<int> *root, int x, int y)
{
	if(root==NULL){
        return -1; 
    }
    if(root->data==x || root->data==y){
        return root->data;
    }
    int left=lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, x, y);
    int right=lowestCommonAncestor(root->right,  x, y);

    if(left!=-1 && right!=-1){
        return root->data;
    }else if(left!=-1 && right==-1){
        return left;
    }
    else if(left==-1 && right!=-1){
        return right;
    }else{
        return -1;
    }
}
