Problem statement
You are given a number ’n’.
Find the number of digits of ‘n’ that evenly divide ‘n’.
Note:
A digit evenly divides ‘n’ if it leaves no remainder when dividing ‘n’.
Example:
Input: ‘n’ = 336
Output: 3
Explanation:
336 is divisible by both ‘3’ and ‘6’. Since ‘3’ occurs twice it is counted two times.

int countDigits(int n){
	int rem=0;
    int m=n, count=0;
    while(n>0)
    {
		rem=n%10;
        if(rem!=0){
        if(m%rem==0)
        {
            count++;
        }
    }
    n=n/10;
    }
     return count;	
}
