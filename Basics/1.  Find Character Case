Problem statement
Write a program that takes a character as input and prints 1, 0, or -1 according to the following rules.
1, if the character is an uppercase alphabet (A - Z).
0, if the character is a lowercase alphabet (a - z).
-1, if the character is not an alphabet.


Example:
Input: The character is 'a'.

Output: 0

Explanation: The input character is lowercase, so our answer is 0.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   char x;
   cin>>x;
   if(x>='a' && x<='z'){
	   cout<<0;
   }else if(x>='A' && x<='Z'){
	   cout<<1;
   }else{
	   cout<<-1;
   }
	
}
