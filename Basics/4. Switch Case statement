Problem statement
Programming languages have some conditional / decision-making statements that execute when some specific condition is fulfilled.
Switch-case is one of the ways to implement them.
In a menu-driven program, the user is given a set of choices of things to do (the menu) and then is asked to select a menu item.
There are 2 choices in the menu:
Choice 1 is to find the area of a circle having radius 'r'.
Choice 2 is to find the area of a rectangle having dimensions 'l' and 'b'.
You are given the choice 'ch' and an array 'a'.
If ‘ch’ is 1, ‘a’ contains a single number ‘r’. If ‘ch’ is 2, ‘a’ contains 2 numbers, ‘l’ and ‘b’.
Consider the choice and print the appropriate area.
Example :
Input: ‘ch’ = 2 and ‘a’ = [3, 2]
Output: area = 6

double areaSwitchCase(int ch, vector<double> a) {
	double area=0.0;
	switch(ch){
		case 1:{
			 area=M_PI*a[0]*a[0];
			 break;
		}
		case 2:{
			area=a[0]*a[1];
			break;
		}
		default:
		cout<<"Invalid choice";
	}
	return area;

}
