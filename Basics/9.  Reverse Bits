Problem statement
There is a song concert going to happen in the city.
The price of each ticket is equal to the number obtained after reversing the bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer â€˜nâ€™.
Sample Input 1 :
2
0
12
Sample Output 1:
 0
 805306368
Explanation For Sample Input 1 :
For the first test case :
Since the given number N = 0 is represented as 00000000000000000000000000000000 in its binary representation.
So after reversing the bits, it will become 00000000000000000000000000000000 which is equal to 0 only. So the output is 0.     



For the second test case :
Since the given number N = 12 is represented as 00000000000000000000000000001100 in its binary representation.
So after reversing the bits, it will become 0110000000000000000000000000000, which is equal to 805306368 only. So the output is 805306368.


long reverseBits(long n) {
    int count=31;
    long ans=0;
    while(n){
        ans+=(n&1)*pow(2,count--);
        n=n>>1;
    }
    return ans;
}
