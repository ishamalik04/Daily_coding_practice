Problem statement
Return the number of undirected graphs that can be formed using 'N' vertices, allowing for disconnected components within the graph. Self-edges and multiple edges are not allowed.

For Example:
For N = 2,
Count is 2.
Consider the vertices to be ‘A’ and ‘B’.
These are the possible 2 graphs.  

int countingGraphs(int N)
{
    return pow(2,((N*(N-1)/2)));
}
