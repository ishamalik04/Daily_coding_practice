Problem statement
Sam is making a Triangular painting for a maths project.
An N-dimensional Triangle is represented by the lower triangle of the pattern filled with integers starting from 1.
For every value of ‘N’, help sam to print the corresponding N-dimensional Triangle.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 
1
1 2 
1 2 3

void nTriangle(int n) {
	for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
		for(int j=1;j<=i;j++){
			printf("%d ",j);
		}
		printf("\n");
	}
}
