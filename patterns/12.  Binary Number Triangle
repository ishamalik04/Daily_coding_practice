Problem statement
Aryan and his friends are very fond of the pattern. For a given integer ‘N’, they want to make the N-Binary Number Triangle.

You are required to print the pattern as shown in the examples below.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 

1
0 1
1 0 1

void nBinaryTriangle(int n) {
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        int start=1;
        if(i%2==0) start=1;
        else start=0;
        for(int j=0;j<=i;j++){
            printf("%d ",start);
            start=1-start;
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}
