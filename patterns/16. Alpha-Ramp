Problem statement
Sam is curious about Alpha-Ramp, so he decided to create Alpha-Ramp of different sizes.

An Alpha-Ramp is represented by a triangle, where alphabets are filled from the top in order.

For every value of ‘N’, help sam to return the corresponding Alpha-Ramp.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 
A
B B
C C C

void alphaRamp(int n) {
    char a='A';
    for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
        for(int j=1;j<=i;j++){
            cout<<a<<" ";
        }
        a++;
        cout<<endl;
    }
}
